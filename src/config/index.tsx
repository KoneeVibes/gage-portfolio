Gradually I have been able to turn my love for video games into a passion for programming. I have moved on from video game developing more to computer science focused competitions and AI. However, I do look back fondly on two projects I did a couple years ago. The first was a submission for the Apple WWDC scholarship (Description: If you are a student or developer with high-end software and app development knowledge, applying for the WWDC Scholarship in 2023 is the best fit.) where I was the second youngest person in second youngest student in the world and youngest in Asia Pacific for this chemistry teaching APP. The second was the China National competition for Roblox where my project that let players experience Chinese Culture and holidays won the National Roblox Youth Developer and Outside Mainland China categories.

There were not a lot of people my age to play against at the courts I play so I started a squash club at Huitong school in the start of the 2023-2024 school year. I have located a squash club about a ten minute taxi ride from school. Going to the squash club and back leaves less time for playing but we still have fun. We are a small group now but it is growing. If you are at Nanshan Huitong school and want to join, please contact me. Here is a video hitting with the coach.I have had a three different coaches so far and he is the best but he often participates in tournaments so I still practice with the other coaches.You can check to see if you feel my skills are decent after picking up a squash racket for the first time less than two years ago.If you do and are interested in taking the next step with your squash playing and live in the Nanshan area, contact me and I will put you in touch.",
