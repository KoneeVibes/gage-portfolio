                        Hi everyone, my name is Gage and I am in 9th grade at Nanshan Huitong School. I have a strong interest in computer science that started from my love of gaming and science. I first learned scratch and quickly after that learned python. When I was 12 I made game using Swift to help students learn the periodic table that won the Apple WWDC student scholarship and later learned Lua to make a game celebrating Chinese traditions which won two awards for the Roblox national gaming competition. Up until then, I was shying away from the more challenging computer science path but as I started to love math, I began to get into competitions like ACSL.

                        Along the way, I moved from YKPAO school in Shanghai to Nanshan Whittle School in Shenzhen and that led me to find new interests outside of coding. I have spent the last two years more focused on acting, teaching, student government, squash, business and exploring new scientific areas than I have coding. Itâ€™s been wonderful. I still have a great interest in computer science and have been doing a project related to my two passions that ties AI into molecular dynamics but I have found there is so much more out there that enjoy diving into.
